# Mortgage Calculator

This project is a **Mortgage Calculator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to input mortgage details and see real-time calculations of their monthly and total repayments. It's designed with usability and accessibility in mind, providing a smooth experience across different devices and input methods.

## Features

Users should be able to:

- **Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form**: The calculator dynamically updates and displays the repayment information based on the userâ€™s input.
- **See form validation messages if any field is incomplete**: Built-in form validation ensures that all necessary fields are filled out correctly before allowing the calculation.
- **Complete the form only using their keyboard**: The interface is fully navigable using a keyboard, making it accessible for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies.
- **View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size**: The responsive design adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page**: Visual cues like hover and focus states help users interact with the page more effectively, enhancing the overall user experience.
